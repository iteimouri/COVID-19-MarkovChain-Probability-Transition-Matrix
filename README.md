# COVID-19-MarkovChain-nthOrder-Probability-Transition-Matrix
This is a Mathematica notebook that contains genomic sequence of COVID-19 and calculates the n-th order Markov Chain probability transition matrices of it. 

To use this you need to download the whole folder and open the `.nb` file using Mathematica. You can further export the matrices as a `.csv` file so to use it elsewhere. 

First order Markov Chain specifies that the probability of a state depends only on the probability of the previous state, we can build more “memory” into our states by using a higher order Markov model. On the `.nb` file you can change the order by changing the value of `n`. 

You can check the examples from `COVID-19_1stOrder` and `COVID-19_2ndOrder`. 

General Info: Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae group and contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome surrounded by a corona-like helical envelope. Approximately 100 sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have been published and these suggest there are two types, Type I and Type II, of which the latter came from the Huanan market in China while the Type I strain came from an unknown location (Zhang 2020). The genome consists of 29,751 base pairs (NC_045512.2) and the genome is about 80% homologous with SARS viruses (NCBI 2020, Fisher 2020).
