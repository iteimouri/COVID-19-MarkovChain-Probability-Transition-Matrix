# COVID-19-MarkovChain-nthOrder-Probability-Transition-Matrix
This is a Mathematica notebook that contains genomic sequence of COVID-19 and calculates the n-th order Markov Chain probability transition matrices of it. 

To use this you need to download the whole folder and open the `.nb` file using Mathematica. You can further export the matrices as a `.csv` file so to use it elsewhere. 

First order Markov Chain specifies that the probability of a state depends only on the probability of the previous state, we can build more “memory” into our states by using a higher order Markov model. On the `.nb` file you can change the order by changing the value of `n`.
